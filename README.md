# DEMO RTS 

The purpose of this demo is to demonstrate few of the basic features used in Unreal Engine 4 for 
programmers. This was developed for the purpose of a 1 day workshop and is intented for use as a reference to it.

## Getting it to work
The project was developed using Unreal Engine 4.16.2. So treating it as a normal unreal engine project with that version should work.
